        "A museum handbook is a guide to the collections. Different from a visitor guide, which typically provides a floorplan and information about exhibitions that are currently on view, a handbook is often a book-length publication that surveys the institutionâ€™s permanent holdings, introducing noteworthy works of art with brief texts and lush illustrations. Handbooks may be used as a reference guide by visitors who want to know more about the works on view, but they are also frequently purchased as souvenirs or gifts."
