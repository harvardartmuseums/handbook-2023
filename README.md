This is a basic description of your image. 

The image is an oil painting featuring three vibrant, stylized horses with a semi-abstract portrayal. Predominately in shades of orange and brown, the horses are bathed in bold, fluid color strokes that give a sense of movement and life. They are set against a landscape with rolling hills in the background, which is depicted in an array of colors such as yellow, green, purple, and blue. The brushwork is expressive and the composition conveys a sense of freedom and natural beauty. The image is reflective of an expressionist style, emphasizing color and form over realistic representation.
